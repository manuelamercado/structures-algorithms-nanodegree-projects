Union and Intersection of two Linked Lists

In this case we are using Linked Lists with a Node class, and some arrays for auxiliary.

Complexity in time

We are performing some iterations on the lists, and those operations consume O(n) time. Those are the worst case here.

Complexity in space

In this case we are storing data in arrays and in linked lists, which sizes are the same as the input, so worst case scenario here is O(n).
