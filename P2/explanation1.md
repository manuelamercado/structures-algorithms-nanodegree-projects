Finding the Square Root of an Integer

In this case I used a simple function with a for loop.

Complexity in time:

In this case the for loop will run until it founds the square root. Since each time of the loop the number is divided by 2, the time complexity will be O(log(n)).

Complexity in space:

In this case the space used is O(1) since each variable space is reused and it is not a recursive function.
