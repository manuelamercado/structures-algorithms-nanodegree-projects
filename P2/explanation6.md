Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

In this case only a for loop is used given the requirements of the problem, for doing it in a single transversal.

Complexity in time:

In this case the worst case scenario is in the for loop, that will run all over the input, so the answer is O(n).

Complexity in space:

In this case the space used is O(1) since the only space used is for the variables and is reused when it is necessary.
