Dutch National Flag Problem

In this case I used a while loop depending on two indices comparison. This allows that the sorting can be done in a single transversal.

Complexity in time:

In this case the while loop will run until all elements are sorted. The worst case scenario here is O(n).

Complexity in space:

In this case the space used in the loop is the same within the input list, so worst case complexity here is O(1).
